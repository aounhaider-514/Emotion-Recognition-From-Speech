# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using LSTM Networks

A deep learning model that classifies speech audio into emotional categories (happy, sad, angry, etc.) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Achieved **67% test accuracy** on the RAVDESS dataset.


## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Emotion classification from raw audio files
- LSTM-based architecture for temporal pattern recognition
- Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature extraction
- Compatible with standard speech emotion datasets (RAVDESS, CREMA-D)
